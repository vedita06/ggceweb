                <p>
                    Welcome to the UG Integrated BA-LLB (Bachelor of Arts and Bachelor of Legislative Law) program at Gyan Ganga College of Excellence (GGCE). Our five-year undergraduate program is designed to provide students with a strong foundation in both arts and law,
                    preparing them for a rewarding career in the legal field.



                    <h3>BCA Programme Objectives</h3>

                    <p>The basic objective of the programme is to open a channel of admission for computing courses for students, who have done the 10+2 and are interested in taking computing/IT as a career. After acquiring the Bachelor ‘s Degree (BCA) from
                        GGCE/RDVV, there is further educational opportunity to go for an MCA at GGCE or Master ‘s Programme at any other University/Institute if desired. Also, after completing BCA Programme, a student should be able to get entry level
                        job in the field of Information Technology or ITES.</p>

                    <h3>Duration of the Programme </h3>

                    <p>Minimum: 3 Years, Maximum: 6 Years.</p>

                    <h3>Medium of Instruction </h3>

                    <p>The medium of instruction is English. The course material is also in English. However, necessary support will be provided to students coming from vernacular language medium during high school studies.</p>

                    <h3>Credit System</h3>

                    <p>The College follows a unique ‘Credit System’ for its programmes. Each credit is worth 30 hours of student study time, comprising all the learning activities. Thus, a three-credit course involves 90 study hours. This helps the student
                        to understand the academic effort one has to put into successfully completing a course. Completion of the programme requires timely submission of both assignments and the Term End Examination of each course in the programme.</p>

                    <h3>BCA Programme Structure</h3>

                    <p>The programme has been spread over three years. Consequently, there will be one half yearly (internal) one final (annual) university examination every year. The students must appear for both the examinations as per academic calendar/schedule
                        announced by the College/ University. Student may ensure that she/he paid the requisite fee as well as fulfils other requirements such as prescribed minimum attendance etc. before appearing in the term end examinations. The result
                        may be withheld or may be cancelled in case it is found that the student’s registration to the course is invalid or did not register. The following is the programme structure of BCA:</p>
